Solved problems like detecting Franigham Heart Study, Polling Predictions, music and Parole.

1.Music Problem: How can we use analytics to predict the popularity of a song? In this assignment, we challenge ourselves to predict whether a song will reach a spot in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart.Taking an analytics approach, we aim to use information about a song's properties to predict its popularity. The dataset songs.csv consists of all songs which made it to the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart from 1990-2010 plus a sample of additional songs that didn't make the Top 10.

2.Parole Problem: Parole boards are charged with identifying which inmates are good candidates for release on parole. They seek to release inmates who will not commit additional crimes after release. In this problem, we will build and validate a model that predicts if an inmate will violate the terms of his or her parole. Such a model could be useful to a parole board when deciding to approve or deny an application for parole.

3.Polling Prediction: Here we are predicting who is going to be next president before any votes have been cast based on previous years elections data as the testing dataset.

4.Franigham Heart Study: Here we are predicting risk factors responsible for heart attack and predict what is the probability of a person having heart attack in next ten years
